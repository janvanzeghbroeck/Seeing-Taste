## Seeing Taste

# Visualization of Beer Tasting
## Through the eyes a Data Scientist

Having a consistent high quality tasting craft product is important but accurately tasting that product can be challenging. Using data science techniques for clustering, statistics, &amp; the powers of python, Seeing Taste uses unsupervised learning to cluster tasters and identify who's good, who has a bias, and who has a specialized pallet all for the sake of making good craft beer.
